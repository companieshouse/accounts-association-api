### Prerequisites
To build the service and execute unit tests, ensure you have the following:
- Java 21
- Maven
- Git

#### WebFlux vs WebMVC
Due to initial performance concerns there were investigations in to various approaches to improve performance without impacting overall architecture.
One of the outcomes of these investigations was a more traditional WebMVC version of this service, which is available at [in the feature/SIV-741-refactor-away-from-reactive branch](companieshouse/accounts-association-api/tree/feature/SIV-741-refactor-away-from-reactive).
It was used as a performance comparison against WebFlux and proved to be slower when running synchronously, resulting in approval of the reactive solution.
Since those performance tests asynchronous email processing has been introduced and performance is comparable, although it's likely less scalable than the WebFlux solution.

## Endpoint Documentation

## Authentication

This API employs two types of authentication:

1. **API Key Authentication:** To authenticate requests using API keys, include the `Authorization` header with the API key.
2. **Bearer Token Authentication:** For bearer token authentication, include a JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

## Adding a new API Endpoint:
### Specification for API: Private Java and Controllers
In this section, we will enhance the specification file to encompass:

- API Endpoint
- Comprehensive Parameter Description (Header, Query, and Path)
- Exemplary Dataset

Upon finalization of the controller code, integration testing, such as with Postman, can commence.

### Create Service and Mongo Dao and Repository

Steps:

- Utilize the model class as a foundation for creating the DAO.
- Within the service class, establish values for any read-only fields.
- Author unit and integration tests (MongoDB)
- Integrate the controller to utilize the service.
- Following approval and compilation of this code, testers can commence testing for the functionality.

### Add Validation in the Service if required

Service should do any business or database checks. If a resource request is not found then a 404 error is returned

A business validation error will throw an exception that will be handled in the application ControllerAdvice class and a HTTP Bad request is returned with an Errors object from the CH standard Errors class.

## Getting Started with Docker
To set up and build the service using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Clone Docker CHS Development repository and follow instructions in the README.
2. Execute the following:
    - `./bin/chs-dev services enable accounts-association-api`
    - `./bin/chs-dev development enable accounts-association-api`
3. Ensure you're using Java 21
4. Start Docker using `tilt up` in the docker-chs-development directory. 
5. Open the tilt window and wait for `accounts-association-api` to become green.
6. Open your browser and navigate to http://api.chs.local/associations/healthcheck.

Note: These instructions are tailored for a local Docker environment.

For further details, please refer to the documentation and associated resources.
